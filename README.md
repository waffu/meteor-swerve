# meteor-swerve

it involves a web based game called meteor swerve, you are a spaceship and must dodge incoming meteors

this was made for a high school course and uses:
* javascript canvas for the game screen
* custom php backend
* captcha
* salting and hashing for the login

currently logging in does nothing but serve the game files and the backend includes some nasty if statements, but it still serves as a good piece of coursework for future reference to show intuition, as i was new to web development and had to self-teach multiple different kinds of web concepts
